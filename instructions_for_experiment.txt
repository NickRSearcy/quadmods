0) Intro - legal text, etc.
1) Pre-test: Consists of 16 questions

2) Training: Should be flexible, and include the following options
	2.1) A method for showing which of a set of shapes is in a particular category (e.g. array of 8 shapes, inc., s r h p (two of each)). In other words, a way to highlight examples.
		2.1.1) "A teacher is going to give you some examples of a XYZ [s / r / h / p]"
		2.1.2) Positive and negative examples
	2.2) A method for describing principles, e.g. "A rhombus has two equal angles"

3) Post-test: The same items as before.

4) Debriefing: comments, demographics (age, gender, max level of education - census categories), math background (what was the last math class you took, how long ago in years), do you think of yourself as someone who likes math: 1 - not at all, 7 - a lot


The questions are:

Are all squares parallelograms?
Are all squares rectangles?
Are all squares also rhombuses?
Are all rectangles also parallelograms?
Are all rectangles also rhombuses?
Are all rectangles also squares?
Are all rhombuses also parallelograms?
Are all rhombuses also rectangles?
Are all rhombuses also squares?
Are all parallelograms also rectangles?
Are all parallelograms also rhombuses?
Are all parallelograms also squares?

// How to get bootstrap button values (?!)

var num = null;
$(".btn-group > button.btn").on("click", function(){
    num = +this.innerHTML;
    alert("Value is " + num);
});

// I think this works better (at all):
$("#my_radiogroup .active").data("value");







For baseline condition: Choose carefully so that you can learn as much as you can about rhombuses. After you're done, you will be tested again on your knowledge. 

And time the time they take on the testing slide.
