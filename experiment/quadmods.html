It also provides a single method, submit(data), which you use to submit data to Turk. If no submission URL has been provided (because, e.g. you're testing your code outside of the Turk environment), submit displays what would have been submitted (without, obviously, any Turk-specific variables like workerId and assignmentId). -->
